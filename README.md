Connect X

Connect X is a customizable, multiplayer expansion of the classic Connect Four game. It was built to explore flexible game rules, clean object-oriented design, and scalable game logic beyond the traditional two-player format.

The game allows players to fully customize the experience — from board size to win conditions — enabling everything from classic gameplay to larger, more strategic multiplayer matches.

Why I Built This

I wanted to extend a well-known game in a way that emphasizes:

Configurable systems

Rule validation

Scalable logic

Clean, testable Java code

Connect X demonstrates how a simple concept can grow into a more complex system when flexibility and extensibility are core design goals.

Features

Supports 2–10 players

Configurable board size (up to 10 rows × 10 columns)

Adjustable win condition (up to 10 tokens in a row)

Turn-based gameplay with enforced rules

Win detection across horizontal, vertical, and diagonal directions

Input validation and error handling

Customization

Players can configure:

Number of players

Board dimensions

Number of tokens required to win

This makes it possible to play anything from classic Connect Four to large, competitive multiplayer variants.
